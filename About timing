üéØ Goal of the Tick Generator
We want to slow down the system clock and generate a short "tick" pulse every N clock cycles. This is useful in games like Tetris where you want a move or update (like a falling block) to happen at a slow, controlled rate ‚Äî for example, once every 0.5 seconds ‚Äî even though the system clock might be running at 50 MHz.

üì¶ The Inputs and Output
clk: The high-speed system clock from the FPGA (e.g., 50 MHz).

rst: A reset input to start fresh ‚Äî clears internal counters and outputs.

tick: The output pulse that tells the rest of the system, "Hey! Time for a game update!"

üîÅ The Counter Logic
1. Counting Clock Cycles
verilog
Copy code
logic [$clog2(N)-1:0] count;
This defines a variable called count that holds a number. It starts from 0 and increases by 1 on every clock cycle.

$clog2(N) means "calculate the number of bits we need to store up to N".

So if N is 10, $clog2(10) = 4 because 4 bits can count up to 15 (which is enough).

2. Always Block (The Heart of the Module)
verilog
Copy code
always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
This means:

"Run this logic on every rising edge of the clock (posedge clk) or if the reset goes high (posedge rst)."

This is the standard way of writing sequential logic that updates with every clock pulse.

3. Reset Behavior
verilog
Copy code
if (rst) begin
    count <= 0;
    tick <= 0;
When rst is high:

We reset the counter to 0.

We also make sure tick is 0 (so the system doesn't think it's time to update when it isn't).

This ensures that when the system starts or is manually reset, it begins cleanly.

4. Main Counting Logic
verilog
Copy code
if (count == N-1) begin
    count <= 0;
    tick <= 1;
Every time the counter reaches N - 1, we:

Reset the counter to 0.

Set tick to 1 for one clock cycle (the current one).

This is the moment we say: ‚ÄúTime to do something!‚Äù

5. Normal Counting Step
verilog
Copy code
else begin
    count <= count + 1;
    tick <= 0;
end
If the counter hasn‚Äôt reached N - 1, just increment it.

tick stays 0.

This part is saying: "Keep counting. Not yet time to tick."

‚úÖ Summary of Logic Flow:
| What happens               | `count` value        | `tick` output | Explanation                     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| System starts (`rst=1`)    | Reset to 0           | 0             | All internal states are cleared |
| Clock ticks, `count < N-1` | Increases each cycle | 0             | Not yet time to tick            |
| When `count == N-1`        | Reset to 0           | 1             | Pulse tick for 1 clock cycle    |
| Next cycle after tick      | 1                    | 0             | Counting starts again           |

üß† Why It‚Äôs Done This Way
We don‚Äôt want a long tick ‚Äî just a single pulse.

A 1-cycle tick is easier to detect and acts like a "flag" for the rest of the system: "Do your thing now!"

Reset gives us a clean starting point ‚Äî important in FPGAs to avoid unwanted behavior at boot.



üß© How It All Fits Together
Imagine we have a game_controller module that handles game updates: moving the falling block down, checking collisions, etc.

We want this game_controller to update once per tick, not every clock cycle.

‚úÖ System Overview
                +-----------------+
                | tick_generator  |
 clk  --------> |                 |----> tick
 rst  --------> |                 |
                +-----------------+

                        |
                        ‚Üì

                +-----------------+
                | game_controller |
                | (uses tick)     |
                +-----------------+
tick_generator creates a slow "heartbeat".

game_controller listens for tick = 1 to move the piece down one row.

üí° Example: Game Controller Snippet
Here's a simplified version of how the Tetris game logic might use the tick:
module game_controller (
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst,
    input logic tick,          // Trigger signal from tick_generator
    output logic [3:0] y_pos   // Position of falling piece (just an example)
);

    logic [3:0] current_y;

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            current_y <= 0;     // Start at top of screen
        end else if (tick) begin
            current_y <= current_y + 1;  // Move down on tick
        end
    end

    assign y_pos = current_y;

endmodule

üîç What Happens Here:
| Signal     | Action                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `rst` = 1  | Resets the block to the top row (`0`) |
| `tick` = 1 | Increments the Y-position by 1        |
| `tick` = 0 | Nothing happens ‚Äî wait for next tick  |
So the block moves down slowly, at the tick rate, rather than falling every clock cycle (which would be way too fast).

üîó Connecting the Modules:
module top_tetris (
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst,
    output logic [3:0] y_pos
);

    logic tick;

    tick_generator #(.N(50000000)) tick_gen (
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst),
        .tick(tick)
    );

    game_controller game (
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst),
        .tick(tick),
        .y_pos(y_pos)
    );

endmodule
‚úÖ Final Result:
Every N clock cycles, tick_generator sets tick = 1 for 1 cycle.

game_controller sees tick = 1 and moves the block down.

This gives a smooth, timed falling effect in Tetris ‚Äî just like in the real game!
